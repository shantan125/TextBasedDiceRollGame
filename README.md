# TextBasedDiceRollGame
Welcome to the TextBasedDiceRollGame repository! This Python project implements a simple text-based dice rolling game. This repository serves as a case study for an advanced data science internship, demonstrating proficiency in Python programming and version control with GitHub.
The TextBasedDiceRollGame is a classic game that simulates rolling a six-sided die in a text-based interface. Players are asked whether they want to start the game, and if they do, they can roll the die and observe the outcome. The game continues until the player decides to stop.
# Features:
Dice Rolling Functionality: The core functionality of this project is the dice rolling mechanism. It utilizes Python's random module to generate random integers between 1 and 6, simulating a die roll. This is achieved using the randint() function.

User Interaction: The game engages the user through the command-line interface by asking whether they want to start and roll the dice. It keeps running until the player decides to exit.

Clean User Interface: The game provides a user-friendly command-line interface, displaying the outcome of each roll and prompting the user for their decision to continue or exit.

# How to Play:
Run the Python script (TextBasedDiceRollGame.py) in your preferred Python environment.
The game will welcome you and ask if you want to start.
Type "yes" or "y" to start and roll the dice, or "no" or "n" to exit.
If you start, the dice will be rolled, and the result will be displayed.
You can continue rolling or exit by answering the respective prompts.

# Use Case:
This project demonstrates the implementation of a simple text-based interactive Python program. It can be used as a foundation for building more complex text-based games or simulations that involve randomization and user interaction.
